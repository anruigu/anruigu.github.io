At **Berkeley**, I switched to CS because I figured the best sci-fi writers were technical. Then I discovered research in [AUTOLab](https://autolab.berkeley.edu), tutored for the class [CS 182/282A: Deep Learning](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs182/fa22/), and [mentored](https://www.berkeleyanova.org/) Oakland students in introductory CS.

I grew up in Beijing and California, where I heavily pursued **writing, cultural, and community** stuff. Living between China and the U.S. has given me a deep appreciation for our **essential humanity**, which I hope accentuate via my work and in life.
