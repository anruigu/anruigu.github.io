My gift is building bridges, turning unconventional experiences into strengths. I grew up in Beijing and California steeped deeply in the humanities -- **writing, cultural, and community** pursuits. I've spent half my life in each place and swear by the things that **unite** instead of **divide** us. I seek to apply this bridge-building principle to intelligences in general.
