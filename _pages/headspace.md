### Thinking about:
- **Cognition / consciousness / wisdom**: pre-verbal things & neuroscience
- **Identity -> behavior**: I think I’m a good thinker. However, that is maybe just half of who I am
- Creating a **being** vs creating a **product**: the role of critical thinking, utility
    - e.g. Replicants in Blade Runner or fabricants in Cloud Atlas
    - Can’t be too smart for your own good
- Things unique to humans to increasingly **differentiate**: risk-taking & boundary-pushing

### Favorite books in no particular order 
Fuel to fire of my main character phase:
- Foundation’s Edge by Asimov
- Contact by Carl Sagan
- Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons
- 1984
- When asked for Chinese book recs, I suggest 文化苦旅, or A Bitter Journey through Culture. Though obscure, it was maybe half of my personality through middle school

Female main character energy again:
- Elisabeth (a German musical about a romance with *der Tod* aka Death… you must check it out at least once in life)
- Frozen
