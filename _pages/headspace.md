### Thinking about:
- **Cognition / consciousness / wisdom**: pre-verbal things & neuroscience
- **Identity -> behavior**: I think I’m an okay thinker, but that's maybe less than half of who I am
- Creating a **being** vs creating a **product**: the role of critical thinking, utility
    - e.g. Replicants in Blade Runner or fabricants in Cloud Atlas
    - Can’t be too smart for your own good
- Things unique to humans to increasingly **differentiate**: risk-taking & boundary-pushing

### A note on imposter syndrome
I'm really grateful to work among the dense cluster people who lived and breathed STEM, did lots of research, and won international competitions. When I first got interested in AI, I'd wanted to be a sci-fi writer. Part of my bridge-building is to help aspiring folks feel like they belong. Please feel free to reach out on X if you'd like to chat.


### Favorite books in no particular order 
- Foundation’s Edge by Asimov
- Contact by Carl Sagan
- Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons
- 1984
- When asked for Chinese book recs, I suggest 文化苦旅, or A Bitter Journey through Culture. Though obscure, it was maybe half of my personality through middle school
