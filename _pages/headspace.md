## Currently top of mind:
- Cognition / consciousness / wisdom
    - Thinking & consciousness. Pre-verbal things
- Identity as a root of behavior
    - I think I’m a good thinker. However, that is maybe just half of who I am
- How neuroscientists / cognitive scientists think about this
- Creating a **being** vs creating a **product** (both humans & AI): critical thinking, utility
    - e.g. Replicants in Blade Runner or fabricants in Cloud Atlas, or geishas
    - Can’t be too smart for your own good
- Things unique to humans that we can differentiate more and more: risk-taking & boundary-pushing

## Favorite books in no particular order 
Fuel to fire of my main character phase:
- Foundation’s Edge by Asimov
- Contact by Carl Sagan
- Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons
- 1984
- When asked for Chinese book recs, I suggest 文化苦旅, or A Bitter Journey through Culture. Though obscure, it was maybe half of my personality through middle school

### [My Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45587605-anrui-gu)

## Favorite musicals
Female main character energy again:
- Elisabeth (a German musical about a romance with *der Tod* aka Death… you must check it out at least once in life)
- Frozen
- Wicked
- Hadestown
